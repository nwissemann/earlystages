        <h1>how can we reach our goals?</h1>

        <p>
          Most personal growth comes down to something pretty simple:
        </p>

        <p>
          You start with where you are.
        </p>

        <p>
          Are you happy with the status quo? What are the areas that need changing? Are you seeing your current situation clearly?
        </p>

        <p>
          Once that’s figured out, you can begin to define where you want to go.
        </p>

        <p>
          Who’s the person you want to become? What do you want to learn? What’s your north star?
        </p>

        <p>
          Let’s say you want to learn a new language.
        </p>

        <p>
          Right now, you speak German and English (your current state), but your goal is to hold a full conversation in French (your desired future state).
        </p>

        <p>
          That’s the basic structure. But then the real question becomes:
        </p>

        <h2>how do you bridge the gap?</h2>

        <p>
          This is where most self-help literature lives – offering answers for <em>how</em> to close that gap between where you are and where you want to be.
        </p>

        <p>
          The schools of thought vary widely:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>"Change your habits and systems" – <em>Atomic Habits</em></li>
          <li>"Manifest your desired future" – <em>The Secret</em></li>
          <li>"Get better at task management" – <em>Getting Things Done</em></li>
          <li>"Remove distractions and work deeply" – <em>Deep Work</em></li>
          <li>"Reflect and journal to gain clarity" – <em>The Bullet Journal Method</em></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Each of these frameworks touches something important and brings useful ideas to the table. But there is one big problem that many of these schools of thought share:
        </p>

        <h2>motion ≠ action</h2>

        <p>
          You can spend a lot of time managing the system and feel productive while doing so. However, you’re not getting closer to your goal.
        </p>

        <p>
          James Clear brilliantly captured this with his concept of motion vs. action.
        </p>

        <p>
          We spend 40–60% of our time in <em>motion</em>, when what we actually need is 95% <em>action</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>motion</strong> = planning, preparing, organizing, or learning <em>about</em> what to do
        </p>

        <p>
          In the French example: watching YouTube videos on “how to learn a language,” reading blog posts comparing the best apps, or creating a Notion dashboard to track your progress
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>action</strong> = doing the thing that directly moves you forward
        </p>

        <p>
          In this case: reviewing flashcards, practicing grammar, speaking French with someone
        </p>

        <p>
          The problem is that motion feels safe, because it avoids failure or feedback while still giving you the false feeling of working on your goal. But without action, there’s no bridge between your current state and your goal.
        </p>

        <h2>a simple model</h2>

        <p>
          Once your goals are well-defined (a topic for another piece), goal achievement can be understood as the result of three core levers:
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Goal progress = Time invested × Productivity × Directionality</strong>
        </p>

        <h2>1. time invested – are you allocating enough time?</h2>

        <p>
          Even if your system is perfect, it won’t matter if you’re only touching the goal for 10 minutes a week.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><em>Example</em>: You’re trying to learn French, but you’re only practicing once every two weeks. You won’t get very far, no matter how efficient your tools are.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. productivity – are you doing things right?</h2>

        <p>
          This is about efficiency and method.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><em>Example</em>: You memorize 100 French words in 30 minutes instead of two hours.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          This is where most self-help books place their focus. It might be the <em>least</em> important of the three levers.
        </p>

        <h2>3. directionality – are you doing the right things?</h2>

        <p>
          Are your actions actually aligned with your goal?
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><em>Example</em>: Instead of memorizing random vocabulary, you practice phrases you’ll actually use in conversation.</li>
        </ul>

        <hr />

        <p>
          &gt; On the goals you're working toward right now:
        </p>
        <p>
          &gt; <strong>Which lever is your biggest bottleneck – and what can you do to resolve it?</strong>

        <h1>about</h1>

        <p>
        I’m Nick — an early-stage startup operator turned strategy consultant obsessed with a simple question: what actually makes for a happy and fulfilled life.        </p>

        <p>
          For the past eight years, I’ve been moving on and off a fairly default path. Business school, studying abroad, internship after internship, always aiming for the next “tier” of company. And to be honest, I enjoyed large parts of it.
        </p>

        <p>
          At the same time, I kept exploring a parallel track. In my free time, I was drawn to questions around the mind (psychology) and meaning (philosophy). During my business bachelor’s, I studied psychology in parallel. During my management master’s, I built a small non-profit focused on mental health and personal growth, reaching over 100 students through our acceleration program.
        </p>

        <p>
          For a while, I tried to do everything at once, maximizing optionality. Until I couldn’t anymore. Perfectionism, the need for validation, and the feeling of never being “good enough” eventually forced me to stop and rethink what I actually wanted from my early career.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I came out of this little personal crisis, I could finally see more clearly. For the first time in my life, I had a tangible north star, and the conviction that the default game can be fun, but shouldn’t be the goal in itself.
        </p>

        <p>
          That conviction led me to joining a wonderful startup as 1st employee &amp; Founder’s Associate, learning how to build a company from scratch. It also brought me to strategy consulting, where I now spend my days breaking complex problems down to their essence (and building fancy slides).
        </p>

        <p>
          I’m on a journey of building my own second-order career meaningfully and have as much fun &amp; learning curve along the way.

        <h1>what if your 20s aren’t meant to be the best years of your life?</h1>

        <p>
          I recently had a convo with my boss about some life decisions, and she gave me great advice:
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>“Your 20s are for learning, not for maximizing income.”</em>
        </p>

        <p>
          I couldn’t agree more.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are still so many years ahead to pay mortgages and make real money in some fancy job.
        </p>

        <p>
          But our 20s are the best time to learn, explore, and take bold risks:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>No children (usually)</li>
          <li>Low living expenses and fewer financial responsibilities</li>
          <li>High flexibility and social mobility</li>
          <li>Fewer long-term obligations (like caring for a dog, a mortgage, or aging parents)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Now, having hit the halfway mark of my 20s, this sparked a bigger question:
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>What do I want to optimize for in this decade?</strong>
        </p>

        <h2>the best years of your life? or just the most challenging?</h2>

        <p>
          They say your 20s are supposed to be the best time of your life. Statistically, that’s questionable.
        </p>

        <h2>most decisions are <em>large-world problems</em></h2>

        <p>
          Most life decisions in your 20s aren’t <em>small-world problems</em> like a game of chess — where you can know all the outcomes and calculate odds.
        </p>

        <p>
          They’re <strong><em>large-world problems</em></strong>: ambiguous, high-stakes, and hard to predict.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>What should I do with my life?</li>
          <li>Is this the right career, city, relationship?</li>
          <li>What if I make the wrong choice?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          No one can tell you. There’s no simulation mode. There are too many unknowns.
        </p>

        <h2>no wonder so many people report their 20s as one of the least happy decades in life</h2>

        <p>
          Despite the social media hype, your 20s are often not the happiest time of your life. Studies show this decade is one of the most stressful:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Identity formation</strong> – pressure to “find your purpose” while dealing with uncertainty</li>
          <li><strong>Financial instability</strong> – low pay, student loans, rising cost of living</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Social comparison</strong> – everyone seems to be marrying, launching startups, or getting dream jobs
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>

        </p>

        <p>
          This is not to say you can’t make them the best time of your life. It’s merely to say that if you’ve been worrying about the expectation–experience gap: hold tight, the best time is (statistically) yet to come.
        </p>

        <p>
          And there’s hope. These stressors can be growth triggers for building a life you love.
        </p>

        <h2>optimize for ‘identity capital’</h2>

        <p>
          In one of my favorite books, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40603783-the-defining-decade" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><em>The Defining Decade</em></a>, psychologist Meg Jay introduces a powerful idea: <strong>identity capital</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          &gt; <em>Identity capital is our collection of personal assets. It is the repertoire of individual resources that we assemble over time.</em>
        </p>

        <p>
          &gt; <em>These are the investments we make in ourselves, the things we do well enough, or long enough, that they become a part of who we are.</em>
        </p>

        <p>
          What counts as identity capital:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Tangible</strong>: degrees, job experience, credentials, side projects</li>
          <li><strong>Intangible</strong>: confidence, clarity, networks, self-awareness, emotional skills</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          It’s how we build ourselves. It’s the currency of adulthood we use to get the jobs, relationships, and other things we want.
        </p>

        <p>
          It’s a nudge to invest intentionally. That doesn’t mean having everything figured out. But it means doing things that build toward someone you want to be.
        </p>

        <h2>identity capital maximizes the amount of optional future paths</h2>

        <p>
          Let’s revisit Nassim Taleb’s concept of <strong>optionality.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          At its core, optionality simply refers to having a wide range of choices available.
        </p>

        <p>
          For example, if you build a skill that opens up many different career paths, you possess more optionality than someone whose skill limits them to only a few job options.
        </p>

        <p>
          The key benefit of optionality is that in an unpredictable world, it allows you to succeed even without knowing exactly what the future holds.
        </p>

        <p>
          &gt; <em>“Options, any options, by allowing you more upside than downside, are vectors of antifragility.</em>
        </p>

        <p>
          &gt; <em>– Nassim Taleb, Antifragility</em>
        </p>

        <p>
          In your 20s, you may not know what you want long-term. That’s why it’s smart to build options rather than fixed plans early in life:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Build transferable skills (problem-solving, writing, speaking, collaboration)</li>
          <li>Try different projects, roles, industries, or geographies</li>
          <li>Create things: a portfolio, a blog, a personal brand, a side hustle</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>Options create both leverage to negotiate and freedom in decision-making.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          Optionality is not always the best strategy. If you’re aiming for a very specific path (e.g. malaria vaccine research), you <em>do</em> need to specialize early and give up alternatives.
        </p>

        <p>
          Still, for most of us, early generalism and flexibility pay greater dividends than over-narrowing too soon.
        </p>

        <h2>your 20s don’t need to be optimized for money, stability, or perfection.</h2>

        <p>
          They’re a decade to <strong>build identity capital</strong> as it gives you the freedom to shape your life.
        </p>

        <p>
          Forget the pressure of the “perfect plan.” Most choices you make now are reversible or reframable.
        </p>

        <p>
          Explore widely. Try things out. Take detours. Invest in who you're becoming, not just what you're doing.
        </p>

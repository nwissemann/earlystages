          “Show me a family of readers, and I will show you the people who move the world.”
        </p>

        <p>
          — Napoleon Bonaparte
        </p>

        <p>
          And although this is the same man who (allegedly) wrote “I will return in three days; don’t wash.”
          to his wife Josephine, he still has a point.
        </p>

        <p>
          Books are a way to access the life’s work of great (wo)men, condensed into a few hundred pages,
          for nothing more than a few euros.
        </p>

        <p>
          Below you can find a list of the books that influenced me the most,
          or at least left the biggest impression.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you end up reading any of them, let me know how you liked them!
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            a man‘s search for meaning<br />
            — victor frankl<br />
            Even if all your freedoms are taken (like the author’s during the Shoah),
            you still have the freedom to choose how you react.
          </li>

          <li>
            skin in the game<br />
            — nassim taleb<br />
            So many problems in the world stem from asymmetric risks, i.e. the fact that
            decision-makers don’t suffer the negative consequences of their decisions
            while benefiting from the upside.
          </li>

          <li>
            hell yeah or no<br />
            — derek sivers<br />
            Regularly say yes to the risky growth opportunities instead of safety.
            Still, if it’s not a “hell yeah,” it should probably be a “no.”
          </li>

          <li>
            the defining decade<br />
            — meg jay<br />
            Despite what everybody tells us, research suggests that the 20s are not the
            “greatest time of our lives.” It’s the time for exploration, trying stuff,
            building an identity.
          </li>

          <li>
            waking up<br />
            — sam harris<br />
            “I” am not a singular entity, I’m rather split into a thinker and an observer
            (a realization from duality meditation). More paradoxically, if you look close
            enough the self dissolves entirely, realizing there is no observer looking at
            the world from behind our eyes (non-duality meditation).
          </li>

          <li>
            the pathless path<br />
            — paul millerd<br />
            It’s too easy to follow the most prestigious, admired, and ‘default’ career
            tracks. But there’s a chance to do our own thing, to follow a “pathless path”.
            It took Paul several strategy consulting roles, including at McKinsey &amp; BCG,
            to figure that out.
          </li>

          <li>
            die with zero<br />
            — bill perkins<br />
            Old school financial advice of backloading spendings, i.e. saving as much as
            possible when we’re young for retirement and inheritance has a big flaw:
            being young holds the best chance to live and experience the world. You most
            likely won’t backpack through India and sleep in 16-bed dorms at 70.
          </li>

          <li>
            beyond the wand<br />
            — tom felton<br />
            Will never forget the image of Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) taking “a breath of
            fresh air” with Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton), just to pull a cigarette out of his
            fake wizard beard during the filming of Dumbledore’s death scene. A fun read
            for Harry Potter fans and a masterclass in finding the strength to show
            weakness (opening up about his alcohol addiction).
          </li>

          <li>
            irresistible<br />
            — adam alter<br />
            Addiction to phones &amp; social media is a lopsided arms race, as the systems
            are made to play us. But we have the chance to build behavioral architectures
            to avoid this.
          </li>

          <li>
            dopamine nation<br />
            — anna lembke<br />
            This little neurotransmitter makes us miserable because we are working so
            hard not to be. Neuroadaptation forces us to seek more extreme dopamine hits
            next time. Using self-binding mechanisms, we can make this weakness our
            greatest power.
          </li>

          <li>
            siddharta<br />
            — hermann hesse<br />
            Some things can’t be taught, but have to be experienced. Hesse’s Siddhartha
            moves through the wildest life circumstances to achieve enlightenment, and
            so can we as a means of self-discovery.
          </li>

          <li>
            leonardo da vinci<br />
            — walter isaacson<br />
            To understand things in depth, you need to first look at all the details
            individually. You need to observe every single aspect before looking at the
            whole. Leonardo used this to become a jack-of-all-trades, e.g. by inferring
            that the heart valve opens and closes due to blood swirls, inspired by river
            flows (450 years before this was scientifically proven).

        <h1>what is happiness, actually?</h1>

        <p>
          The topic of happiness might be the concept that’s most striven for while also being the hardest to grasp.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are countless different definitions of happiness, millions of ways to understand and achieve it.
        </p>

        <p>
          All while it remains one of the ultimate goals of life.
        </p>

        <p>
          To manage expectations, this newsletter will not provide you with the ultimate answer. Other than those BS personal development Youtubers/ authors, I will not give you the one-size-fits-all simple answer to achieve happiness.
        </p>

        <p>
          Here’s what I did instead: I went through the four books on happiness I had on the table – and will compare them with each other and bring them together into one overarching model. No claim to be exhaustive whatsoever. Just an attempt to put some order in this topic’s definitional chaos.
        </p>

        <h2>01 – naval ravikant (the almanack of naval ravikant)</h2>

        <p>
          Naval is the founder of AngelList and early investor of companies like Uber, Twitter, etc., and a highly practical philosopher. He understands happiness as your natural state when nothing is missing, when desire and mental chatter subside.
        </p>

        <p>
          In other words – happiness is the basis, we just have to strip away the noise by achieving mental presence.
        </p>

        <p>
          He strongly recommends meditation and introspection practices as primary means to get there.
        </p>

        <h2>02 – mo gawdat (solve for happy)</h2>

        <p>
          Mo Gawdat (serial founder and ex Google C-Suite) breaks happiness down into a formula:
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Happiness = Perception of life’s events − Expectations.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          When reality meets or exceeds expectations, you’re happy. If your expectations are unrealistically high, you will suffer.
        </p>

        <p>
          He focuses on expectation management and cognitive reframing as key levers.
        </p>

        <h2>03 – robert waldinger &amp; marc schulz (the good life)</h2>

        <p>
          These two guys are part of the very famous Harvard happiness study that observed multiple generations over time.
        </p>

        <p>
          They found a good life to be defined by warm, supportive relationships that sustain well-being over time. In ivory tower terms – it offers robust longitudinal evidence that relationships are the strongest predictor of lifelong well-being.
        </p>

        <p>
          The recommendation is as easy as it is hard to realize, urging us to invest in and maintain relationships.
        </p>

        <h2>04 – paul dolan (happiness by design)</h2>

        <p>
          Paul Dolan, an LSE psychologist, takes a behavioral science lens by viewing happiness as the result of where you allocate your attention and how you design your behavior.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Happiness = Pleasure + Purpose</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          He thinks you can increase your happiness by reallocating your attention with behavioral nudges and designing your environment to reduce distraction and autopilot.
        </p>

        <h2>bottom line: synthesizing these views</h2>

        <p>
          We often talk about happiness like it’s a single thing — as if one magic lever could fix it all. Some of these perspectives focus on inner peace, on expectation or attention management, or on your social net.
        </p>

        <p>
          For me, this points toward the idea that happiness isn’t one-dimensional. It’s multi-layered.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you’re a bit like me, you might feel the pressing urge to bring these different conceptions into an overarching framework to cut through the noise.
        </p>

        <p>
          I wanted to make sense of these seemingly different takes, so I created a simple 2×2 framework to map them out. Here’s my <strong>four-component model</strong> — I hope it’s useful.
        </p>

        <p>
          To make sense of them, I started playing with a simple 2×2 lens:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Present ↔ Future</strong> on the horizontal axis</li>
          <li><strong>Individual ↔ Collective</strong> on the vertical axis</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          This gives us four quadrants (<strong>PPAA</strong>), four distinct but complementary dimensions that together shape how we experience happiness:
        </p>

        <!-- MATRIX TABLE -->
        <table class="matrix">
          <tr>
            <td></td>
            <th>future</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>collective</th>
            <td>
              <strong>people</strong><br />
              Being surrounded by those you love and can lean on
            </td>
            <td>
              <strong>purpose</strong><br />
              Living or working toward something meaningful
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>individual</th>
            <td>
              <strong>awareness</strong><br />
              Being centered in the present and feeling serenity or joy
            </td>
            <td>
              <strong>alignment</strong><br />
              Living in coherence with expectations, values, and goals
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <p>
          What I like about this 2×2 is its simplicity. It shows that happiness isn’t a single ‘hack’ but a co-dependent system:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Awareness without Alignment can turn into passivity.</li>
          <li>People without Purpose can feel warm but directionless.</li>
          <li>Purpose without Awareness often leads to burnout.</li>
          <li>Alignment without People risks becoming overly self-focused.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          This framework can be used as a map to look at your state of happiness. Maybe your calendar is full but your mind is scattered (low Awareness). Maybe you’re focused on personal goals but disconnected from others (low People). Maybe you’ve got presence but no sense of direction (low Purpose or Alignment).
        </p>

        <h2>still no idea what happiness is</h2>

        <p>
          Having explored the world of different happiness theories, I still cannot give a clear answer. All of us will have to define our right balance between current joy and future payoff for themselves. Will it make you happier to hit the gym or to order a burger on Uber Eats with your friends on a Thursday night?
        </p>

        <p>
          Whatever it may be, I hope my four-component model gives you some levers to move the needle on what makes you happy <em>today</em>.
        </p>

          &gt; Which quadrant of the framework feels most neglected in your life right now?
        </p>
        <p>
          &gt; And what’s one small action you could take to rebalance it this week?
